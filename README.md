# FlipFlopScript
## A PowerShell that automatically changes the mouse scrolling direction

On windows you cannot simply change the mouse scrolling direction in the settings.
The only method you have is to dig into Registry Editor and change the right parameter for the right device.
You have to do this for all your mice and for all the USB ports.

With the FlipFlopScript (in reference to the "FlipFlopWheel" parameter you have to change in Regedit) you can do it easily without having to open Registry Editor.


## How to use
- Download the script
- Open PowerShell **As Administrator**
- Drag and drop the file in PowerShell
- OR Execute the line below :
```
& "C:\Path_to_the_script\FlipFlopScript.ps1"
```
- Follow the instructions

## Footnotes
- You have to execute this script for each mouse you want to change
- You can restore the scrolling direction to default with the script
